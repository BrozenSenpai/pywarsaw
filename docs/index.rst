pywarsaw
========

An unofficial asynchronous API wrapper for `Warsaw Open
Data <https://api.um.warszawa.pl/>`__.

Created mainly for learning purposes.

Features
--------

-  **Asynchronous**: designed to work with asyncio
-  **Extensive**: cover as many endpoints as possible
-  **Approachable**: all polish fields translated to english
-  **Responsible**: minimize the load on the API server

   -  implemented caching

-  **Simple**: easy to use and customize:

   -  object-oriented design
   -  use of data transfer objects
   -  type hinting
   -  convert adequate fields from strings to the more suitable types

-  **Lightweight**: minimal usage of the third-party packages

Installation
------------

::

   pip install pywarsaw

Getting started
---------------

The package goal is to be straightforward to use. For example, you can
obtain a list of objects with information about current air quality in
Warsaw, with caching enabled like this:

.. code:: python

   import asyncio
   import pywarsaw

   async def main():
       client = pywarsaw.Mermaid(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
       await client.cache_enable()

       result = await client.get_air_quality()
       
       await client.close()

   asyncio.run(main())

Or with the context manager:

.. code:: python

   async with pywarsaw.Mermaid(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY") as client:
       await client.cache_enable()
       
       result = await client.get_air_quality()

Caching can be disabled with:

.. code:: python

   await client.cache_disable()

Every object from the obtained list an be converted to the simpler
structures:

.. code:: python

   # convert object to the dictionary
   result_dict = result[0].to_dict()

   # convert object to the tuple
   result_tuple = result[0].to_tuple()

   # convert object to the flat dict - useful for creating Pandas dataframes
   result_flat = result[0].to_flat_dict()

   # convert object to the json string
   result_json = result[0].to_json()
